# Recipe Recommendation System

This project is a recipe recommendation system that suggests recipes based on the ingredients provided by the user. The system uses Word2Vec embeddings to understand the context and similarity between ingredients and employs a content-based filtering approach to generate recommendations. The interactive user interface is built with Streamlit.

## Features

- Parses and preprocesses ingredient lists
- Generates word embeddings for ingredients using Word2Vec
- Calculates document embeddings for recipes using average and TF-IDF weighted embeddings
- Recommends recipes based on cosine similarity between user input and stored recipes
- Interactive web application using Streamlit

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Gensim
- Scikit-Learn
- Streamlit
